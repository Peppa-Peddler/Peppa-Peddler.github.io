          <p>
            There is only one problem with you...
          </p>
          <p>
            And that is that<br><span>I love you</span>...
          </p>
          <p>
            I think It is more a problem of mine than yours.
          </p>
          <p>
            Good news are that It will be over some day.
            In the future I will overcome this. I will go past you and be okay.
            While life still make sense It won't hurt.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will be laughing at how fool I was today.
            How fool I was everyday I had loved you.
          </p>
          <p>
            And just like that, until that day comes, I will be afraid.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will be afraid of seeing you. And just as stupid It sounds, I will also be afraid of not seeing you.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will be afraid of having you close or having you far, to remember you or to forget you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just now I see the world as a contradiction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bad news are that I want to kiss you so badly. Start wondering about previous and next lifes. Those things we do and imagine when we want love to be bigger than our own existence.
          </p>
          <p>When we don't need to know the meaning for life anymore. When we kiss.</p>
          <p>
            And that is a problem I have about you.
