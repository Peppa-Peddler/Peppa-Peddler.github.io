					______ Sing, Goddess, Achilles’ rage,<br>
					Black and murderous, that cost the Greeks<br>
					Incalculable pain, pitched countless souls<br>
					Of heroes into Hades’ dark,<br>
					And left their bodies to rot as feasts<br>
					For dogs and birds, as Zeus’ will was done.<br>
					__ Begin with the clash between Agamemnon--<br>
					The Greek warlord--and godlike Achilles.<br>
					<br>
					__ Which of the immortals set these two<br>
					At each other’s throats?<br>
					____________ Apollo<br>
					Zeus’ son and Leto’s, offended<br>
					By the warlord. Agamemnon had dishonored<br>
					Chryses, Apollo’s priest, so the god<br>
					Struck the Greek camp with plague,<br>
					And the soldiers were dying of it.

					By now, all the others who had fought at Troy—<br>
					At least those who had survived the war and the sea—<br>
					Were safely back home. Only Odysseus<br>
					Still longed to return to his home and his wife.<br>
					The nymph Calypso, a powerful goddess—<br>
					And beautiful—was clinging to him<br>
					In her caverns and yearned to possess him.
